# The Unnamed Game

I'm just using this project to play around and learn a little bit of Gaming.

I decided to use PyGame, because it's very easy to learn and understand how simple games development works.

I'm learning here with the excellent Pygame Tutorial by [@techwithtim](https://github.com/techwithtim/Pygame-Tutorials))
